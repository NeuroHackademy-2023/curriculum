# Machine learning for neuroimaging data with Nilearn

[Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io) is a Python package designed for statistical and machine learning analysis of brain imaging data.
In this tutorial, we focus on some of the practicalities of using machine learning in neuroimaging, particularly (f)MRI.
That is, how do you extract meaningful features from a brain image ?
How do we implement our models in a way that leverages the unique features of neuroimaging signals ?

This series of notebooks focuses on these steps.
You can also view them displayed as a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) at :
