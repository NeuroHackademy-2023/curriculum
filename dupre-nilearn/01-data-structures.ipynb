    "In this tutorial,\n",
    "we'll see how the Python library `nilearn` allows us to easily perform machine learning analyses with neuroimaging data,\n",
    "specifically MRI and fMRI.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "You may notice that the name `nilearn` is reminiscent of [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org),\n",
    "a popular Python library for machine learning.\n",
    "This is no accident!\n",
    "Nilearn and scikit-learn were created by the same team,\n",
    "and nilearn is designed to bring machine **LEARN**ing to the NeuroImaging (**NI**) domain.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neuroimaging data\n",
    "\n",
    "While common machine learning pipelines assume tabular data, neuroimaging data does not have this structure.\n",
    "Instead, can be considered a 4D tensor (3 spatial dimensions + 1 temporal dimension) that has [both spatial and temporal dependencies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01299-3) between successive data points.\n",
    "That is, knowing _where_ and _when_ something was measured tells you information about the surrounding data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also know that neuroimaging data contains a lot of noise that's not blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD), such as head motion.\n",
    "Since we don't think that these other noise sources are related to neuronal firing,\n",
    "we often need to consider how we can make sure that our analyses are not driven by these noise sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all considerations that most machine learning software libraries are not designed to deal with!\n",
    "Nilearn therefore plays a crucial role in bringing machine learning concepts to the neuroimaging domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a sense of the problem, the quickest method is to just look at some data.\n",
    "You may have your own data locally that you'd like to work with.\n",
    "Nilearn also provides access to several neuroimaging data sets and atlases (we'll talk about these a bit later).\n",
    "\n",
    "These data sets (and atlases) are only accessible because research groups chose to make their collected data publicly available.\n",
    "We owe them a huge thank you for this!\n",
    "The data set we'll use today was originally collected by [Rebecca Saxe](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/rebecca-saxe/)'s group at MIT and hosted on [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000228/versions/1.1.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The nilearn team preprocessed the data set with [fMRIPrep](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io) and downsampled it to a lower resolution,\n",
    "so it'd be easier to work with.\n",
    "We can learn a lot about this data set directly [from the Nilearn documentation](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/modules/generated/nilearn.datasets.fetch_development_fmri.html).\n",
    "For example, we can see that this data set contains over 150 children and adults watching a short Pixar film.\n",

    "and store it in a format that we can easily work with.\n",

    "and when taking into account known sources of noise.\n",
    "To do this, we'll use nilearn's Masker objects.\n",

    "Masking fMRI data.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, we can imagine overlaying a 3D grid on an image.\n",
    "Then, our mask tells us which cubes or “voxels” (like 3D pixels) to sample from.\n",
    "Since our Nifti images are 4D files, we can’t overlay a single grid –\n",
    "instead, we use a series of 3D grids (one for each volume in the 4D file),\n",
    "so we can get a measurement for each voxel at each timepoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Masker objects allow us to apply these masks!\n",
    "To start, we need to define a mask (or masks) that we'd like to apply.\n",
    "This could correspond to one or many regions of interest.\n",
    "Nilearn provides methods to define your own functional parcellation (using clustering algorithms such as _k-means_),\n",

    "\n",
