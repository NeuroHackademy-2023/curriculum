    "When applying machine learning to neuroimaging data, however, equally important are (1) the model that we train to generate predictions and (2) how we assess the generalizability of our learned model.\n",
    "In this context, appropriate cross-validation methods are critical for drawing meaningful inferences.\n",

    "We briefly overview what cross-validation aims to achieve, as well as several different strategies for cross-validation that are in use with neuroimaging data.\n",
    "We then provide examples of appropriate and inappropriate cross-validation within the `development_fmri` dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why cross-validate ?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's formalize the problem that cross-validation aims to solve, using notation from {cite}`Little_2017`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For $N$ observations, we can choose a variable $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ that we are trying to predict from data $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ in the presence of confounds $Z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k}$⁠.\n",
    "For example, we may have neuroimaging data for 155 participants, from which we are trying to predict their age group as either a child or an adult.\n",
    "There are additional confounding measures in this prediction, both measured and unmeasured.\n",
    "For example, motion is a likely confounding variable, as children often move more in the scanner than adults.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notation, we can then consider $y$ as a function of X and Z:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  y = Xw + Zu + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is observation noise, and we have assumed a strictly linear relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such model, $\\epsilon$ may be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) even though the relationship between $y$ and $X$ is not i.i.d; for example, if it changes with age group membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning problem is to estimate a function $\\hat{f}_{\\{ train \\}}$ that predicts best $y$ from $X$.\n",
    "In other words, we want to minimize an error $\\mathcal{E}(y,\\hat{f}(X))$⁠.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is that we are interested in this error on new, unknown, data.\n",
    "Thus, we would like to know the expectaction of the error for $(y, X)$ drawn from their unknown distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\mathbb{E}_{(y,X)} [\\mathcal{E}(y,\\hat{f}(X))].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From this we note two important points.\n",
    "  1. Evaluation procedures _must_ test predictions of the model on held-out data that is independent from the data used to train the model.\n",
    "  2. Cross-validation procedures that repeating the train-test split many times to vary the training set also allow use to ask a related question:\n",
    "    given _future_ data to train a machine learning method on a clinical problem, what is the error that I can expect on new data?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forms of cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the importance of cross-validation in machine learning, many different schemes exist.\n",
    "The [scikit-learn documentation has a section](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html) just on this topic, which is worth reviewing in full.\n",
    "Here, we briefly highlight how cross-validation impacts our estimates in our example dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing cross-validation schemes in our example dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll keep working with the same `development_dataset`, though this time we'll fetch all 155 subjects.\n",
    "Again, we'll derive functional connectivity matrices for each participant, though this time we'll only consider the \"correlation\" measure."
