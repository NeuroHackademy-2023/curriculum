# A Case Study

A global consortium is planning to study the effects of genetic variation on
cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated drug metabolism. This project involves partners
working in Europe, USA, China and Africa and who are working with:
* **laboratory animals** having genetic variants of CYPs; 
* neuroimaging data from transgenic **non-human primates** (NHP) from China;
* neuroimaging data from **living human beings**;
* and groups that use neuroimaging methods to assay the effect of genetic
  variants naturally occurring in the population on brain function.

They plan to build a repository located in the US and the EU where all generated
datasets will be curated and stored. All partners will be expected to have
access to these datasets for the purposes of the research.

**Question**: What are the technical, ethical and legal requirements these
researchers need to consider?
