### What is a branch?

You might have noticed the term *branch* in status messages:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
~~~
{: .output}

and when we wanted to get back to our most recent version of the repository, we
used `git checkout master`.

Not only can our repository store the changes made to files and directories, it
can store multiple sets of these, which we can use and edit and update in
parallel. Each of these sets, or parallel instances, is termed a `branch` and
`master` is Git's default branch.

A new branch can be created from any commit. Branches can also be *merged*
together.

### Why are branches useful?
Suppose we've developed some software and now we want to
try out some new ideas but we're not sure yet whether we'll keep them. We
can then create a branch 'feature1' and keep our `master` branch clean. When
we're done developing the feature and we are sure that we want to include it
in our program, we can merge the feature branch with the `master` branch.
This keeps all the work-in-progress separate from the `master` branch, which
contains tested, working code.

When we merge our feature branch with master git creates a new commit which
contains merged files from master and feature1. After the merge we can continue
developing. **The merged branch is not deleted.** We can continue developing (and
making commits) in feature1 as well.


### Branching in practice

One of our colleagues wants to contribute to the paper but is not quite sure
if it will actually make a publication. So it will be safer to create a branch
and carry on working on this "experimental" version of the paper in a branch
rather than in the master.

~~~
$ git checkout -b paperWJohn
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
Switched to a new branch 'paperWJohn'
~~~
{: .output}

We're going to change the title of the paper and update the author list (adding John Smith).
However, before we get started it's a good practice to check that we're working
on the right branch.

~~~
$ git branch			# Double check which branch we are working on
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
  master
* paperWJohn
~~~
{: .output}

The * indicates which branch we're currently in. Now let's make the changes to the paper.

~~~
$ nano journal.md		# Change title and add co-author
$ git add journal.md
$ git commit			# "Modify title and add John as co-author"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If we now want to work in our `master` branch. We can switch back by using:

~~~
$ git checkout master
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
Switched to branch 'master'
~~~
{: .output}


Notice that the changes that are in the `paperWJohn` branch are not present here. They exist only in that branch! When switching between branches, git literally goes to look for that branch inside of the `.git` directory, and like checking out a book from the library, it checks that state of the filesystem out of the repository to replace the current state.

### Merging it back together

To combine the changes that are in this other branch with your previous work, you can run

~~~
$ git merge paperWJohn
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This adds into your current branch the work that was, until now, only on that other branch. And you can keep going from here.
