## Why version control?

Let's admit it, we all already use some form of version control. Think of the
ways that you and co-authors on papers keep track of the changes that you make
to your documents. It can be a particular naming scheme (often including a date,
and maybe the name of the author that made the most recent changes). Version
control was originally designed to achieve a similar goal in the context of
software development. It was originally really just meant to keep track of a
linear set of changes, so that if an error creeps in, the authors of the
software can go back and figure out what changed and when and root out the
error. But along the way, something interesting and quite wonderful happened.
People using version control also realized that it is a powerful tool for
facilitating collaboration. That's because you can make changes on your version
of the code and I can make changes on my version of the code and we can both
compare these changes to the current state of the main version of the code and
to each other. We can also start having conversations around these differences.
This makes a lot of complicated conversations about proposed changes much more
concrete, because you can show people what you mean, instead of just telling
them. It turns out that this pattern also translates to many other kinds of
text, like documents, grants, even designs. And so, people who use version
control sometimes end up using it in many different aspects of their life, and
with a variety of different collaborators. I can tell you from personal
experience that the consistent use of version control tools has made me overall
a happier and more productive collaborator with others.

That said: wrapping your head around the concepts and details of using version control can be challenging at first. It's probably the thing that you will learn at NeuroHackademy that will take the longest to get used to. So, buckle in and get ready for the ride.

## What is a repository?

Version control is centered round the notion of a *repository* which holds your
directories and files. We'll start by looking at a local repository. The local
repository is set up in a directory in your local file system (local machine).
For this we will use the command line interface.

> ## Why are we using the command line?
> There are lots of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for using Git: both stand-alone
> and integrated into text editors (e.g. VSCode).
> We are deliberately not using a GUI for this course because:
>
> * you will have a better understanding of how the git commands work
> * you will be able to use Git on any computer
> (e.g. remotely accessing HPC systems, which generally only have Linux command line access)
> * you will be able to use any GUI, rather than just the one you have learned

## Setting up Git

If you're using the course JupyterHub, git should already be installed.
If you need to install git locally, instructions are under [setup]({{ page.root }}/setup).

## Tell Git who we are

Git records information not only about the changes to files,
but also about _who_ made those changes.
In collborating, this information is often critical
(e.g., you probably want to know who rewrote your 'Conclusions' section!).
So, we need to tell Git about who we are:

~~~
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name" 			# Put quotation marks around your name
$ git config --global user.email yourname@yourplace.org
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Note that you need to enclose your name in quotation marks!

## Set a default editor

When working with Git we will often need to provide some short but useful information.
In order to enter this information, we need an editor.
We'll now tell Git which editor we want to be the default
(i.e. the one that Git will bring by default whenever it wants us to provide some information).

You can choose any editor available on your system.
For the purpose of this session we'll assume you're on the course JupyterHub and use *nano*, a very simple text editor:

~~~
$ git config --global core.editor nano
~~~
{: .language-bash}

To set up alternative editors, follow the same notation e.g.
`git config --global core.editor notepad`, `git config --global core.editor vi`,
`git config --global core.editor xemacs`.

Mac users can use *TextEdit*: `git config --global core.editor 'open -W -n'`.

## Git's global configuration

We can now preview (and edit, if necessary) Git's global configuration (such as
our name and the default editor which we just set up). If we look in our home
directory, we'll see a `.gitconfig` file,

~~~
$ cat ~/.gitconfig
    [user]
        name = Your Name
        email = yourname@yourplace.org
    [core]
        editor = nano
~~~
{: .language-bash}

**These global configuration settings will apply to any new Git repository
you create on the course JupyterHub.**
If you are executing this tutorial locally, these settings would similarly persist over time;
i.e. the `--global` commands above are only required once per computer.

## Create a new repository with Git

We will be working with a simple example in this tutorial. It will be a paper
that we will first start writing as a single author and then work on it further
with one of our colleagues.

 First, let's create a directory within your home directory:

```
$ cd								# Switch to your home directory.
$ pwd								# Print working directory (output should be /home/jovyan)
$ mkdir git-papers
$ cd git-papers
```
{: .language-bash}

Now, we need to set up this directory up to be a Git repository (or "initiate
the repository"):

~~~
$ git init
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/user/git-papers/.git/
~~~
{: .output}

The directory "git-papers" is now our working directory.

 If we look in this directory, we'll find a `.git` directory:

~~~
$ ls .git
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
branches  config  description  HEAD  hooks  info  objects refs
~~~
{: .output}
The `.git` directory contains Git's configuration files. Be careful not to
accidentally delete this directory!

## Tracking files with a git repository

Now, we'll create a file. Let's say we're going to write a journal paper, so
we will start by adding the author names and a title, then save the file.

~~~
$ nano journal.md
# Add author names and paper title
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Accessing files from the command line

> In this lesson we create and modify text files using a command line interface
> (e.g. terminal, Git Bash etc), mainly for convenience.
> JupyterHub also contains a native text editor that we can use to edit these files.
> That is because these are normal files which are also accessible from the file browser on any operating system (e.g. Windows explorer),
> and by other programs.
{: .callout}

`git status` allows us to find out about the current status
of files in the repository. So we can run,

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
(use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

journal.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~
{: .output}

Information about what Git knows about the directory is displayed. We are on
the `master` branch, which is the default branch in a Git repository
(one way to think of branches is like parallel versions of the project.
Don't worry -- we'll talk more about branches later).

For now, the important bit of information is that our file is listed as
**Untracked** which means it is in our working directory but Git is not
tracking it - that is, any changes made to this file will not be recorded by
Git.

## Add files to a Git repository

To tell Git about the file, we will use the `git add` command:

~~~
$ git add journal.md
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
(use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

      	new file:   journal.md
~~~
{: .output}

Now our file is listed underneath where it says **Changes to be committed**.

`git add` is used for two purposes. Firstly, to tell Git that a given file
should be tracked. Secondly, to put the file into the Git **staging area**
which is also known as the *index* or the *cache*.

The staging area can be viewed as a "loading dock", a place to hold files we have
added, or changed, until we are ready to tell Git to record those changes in the
repository.

![The staging area](../fig/git-staging-area.svg)

## Commit changes

In order to tell Git to record our change, our new file, into the repository,
we need to  **commit** it:

~~~
$ git commit
# Type a commit message: "Add title and authors"
# Save the commit message and close your text editor (nano, notepad etc.)
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Our default editor will now pop up. Why? Well, Git can automatically figure out
that directories and files are committed, and by whom (thanks to the information
we provided before) and even, what changes were made, but it cannot figure out
why. So we need to provide this in a commit message.

If we save our commit message **and exit the editor**, Git will now commit our file.

~~~
[master (root-commit) 21cfbde]
1 file changed, 2 insertions(+) Add title and authors
create mode 100644 journal.md
~~~
{: .output}

This output shows the number of files changed and the number of lines inserted
or deleted across all those files. Here, we have changed (by adding) 1 file and
inserted 2 lines.

Now, if we look at its status,

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
~~~
{: .output}

our file is now in the repository.
The output from the `git status` command means that we have a clean directory
i.e. no tracked but modified files.

Now we will work a bit further on our *journal.md* file by writing the introduction
section.

```
$ nano journal.md
# Write introduction section
```
{: .language-bash}
If we now run,

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

we see changes not staged for commit section and our file is marked as
modified:

~~~
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
(use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

     modified:   journal.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~
{: .output}

This means that a file Git knows about has been modified by us but
has not yet been committed. So we can add it to the staging area and then
commit the changes:

~~~
$ git add journal.md
$ git commit							# "Write introduction"
~~~
{: .language-bash}
Note that in this case we used `git add` to put journal.md to the staging
area. Git already knows this file should be tracked but doesn't know if we want
to commit the changes we made to the file  in the repository and hence we have
to add the file to the staging area.

It can sometimes be quicker to provide our commit messages at the command-line
by doing `git commit -m "Write introduction section"`.

Let's add a directory *common* and a file *references.txt* for references we may
want to reuse:

~~~
$ mkdir common
$ nano common/references.txt					# Add a reference
~~~
{: .language-bash}

We will also add a citation in our introduction section (in journal.md).

~~~
$ nano journal.md 						# Use reference in introduction
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Now we need to record our work in the repository so we need to make a commit.
First we tell Git to track the references.
We can actually tell Git to track everything in the given sub-directory:

~~~
$ git add common						# Track everything currently in the 'common' directory
$ git status							# Verify that common/references.txt is now tracked
~~~
{: .language-bash}

All files that are in *common* are now tracked.  We would also have to add
journal.md in the staging area. But there is a shortcut. We can use
`commit -a`. This option means "commit all files that are tracked and
that have been modified".

~~~
$ git commit -am "Reference J Bloggs and add references file" 	# Add and commit all tracked files
~~~
{: .language-bash}
and Git will add, then commit, both the directory and the file.

In order to add all tracked files to the staging area, use `git commit -a`
(which may be very useful if you edit e.g. 10 files and now you want to commit all of them).
