This repo includes jupyter notebooks for preprocessing intracranial data using MNE python. The tutorial is is two parts.

* Part 1: [`01_ieeg_preprocessing_MNE.ipynb`](01_ieeg_preprocessing_MNE.ipynb) - learn to load, plot raw data and power spectra, and (re)reference data.
* Part 2: [`02_ieeg_preprocessing_MNE_epochs.ipynb`](02_ieeg_preprocessing_MNE_epochs.ipynb) - learn to plot epoched data (e.g. event related potentials), extract data associated with specific annotations.

Helper scripts are included in `ecog_preproc_utils.py`. If you are running this on the jupyter hub as part of the course, you are good to go.
