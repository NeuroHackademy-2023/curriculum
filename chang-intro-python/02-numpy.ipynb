    "Numpy is the backbone of the numerical and scientific computing stack in Python;\n",
    "many of the libraries we'll cover in this book (pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)\n",
    "depend on it internally. Numpy provides many data structures optimized for\n",
    "efficient representation and manipulation of different kinds of high-dimensional\n",
    "data, as well as an enormous range of numerical tools that help us work with\n",
    "those structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the default Python namespace contains only a small number of\n",
    "built-in functions. To use any other functionality, we need to explicitly import\n",
    "it into our namespace. Let's do that for Numpy. The library can be imported\n",
    "using the `import` key word. We use `import numpy as np` to create a short name\n",
    "for the library that we can refer to. Everything that is in `numpy` will now be\n",
    "accessible through the short name `np`. Importing the library specifically as\n",
    "`np` is not a requirement, but it is a very strongly-held convention and when\n",

    "### Data is represented in arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The core data structure in Numpy is the n-dimensional array (or `ndarray`). As\n",
    "the name suggests, an `ndarray` is an array with an arbitrary number of\n",
    "dimensions. Unlike Python lists, Numpy arrays are homogeneously typed -â€”\n",
    "meaning, every element in the array has to have the same data type. You can have\n",
    "an array of floats, or an array of integers, but you can't have an array that\n",
    "mixes floats and integers. This is exactly what we described above: a\n",
    "homogeneous dense table that holds items in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating `ndarray`s\n",

    "directly to the `np.narray()` function. In a relatively simple case, the input\n",
